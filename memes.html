      Writing a Conclusion that doesn't suck (hopefully)
    </h1>
      <p>
        A conclusion should leave a strong impact on your reader, after all it is the last thing they see of your work.
        A conclusion shouldn't introduce any new information, in fact it should just be a summary of everything you introduced previously in your Essay.
        <br />

        The conclusion should accomplish <i>3</i> major tasks:

        <br />

        <ul>
          <li> Restate your main idea or thesis </li>
          <li> Summarize any subpoints of your essay </li>
          <li> Leave the reader with an interesting final impression </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
